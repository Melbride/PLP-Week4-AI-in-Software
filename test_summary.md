### Selenium Test Summary (Placeholder)

I planned to use Selenium IDE or Testim.io to automate a login page test.

Due to time constraints, I couldn’t complete the automation, but I learned that:

- AI tools help by auto-generating test cases based on page elements.
- This expands test coverage by testing edge cases humans might miss.

🛠️ I will update this with code and screenshots later.
