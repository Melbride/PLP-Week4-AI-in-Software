### Code Comparison: Manual vs Copilot

Both manual and Copilot-generated code use the `sorted()` function and a lambda to sort a list of dictionaries.

- Copilot generated the code instantly after typing the function comment.
- Manual implementation required slightly more thinking and testing.

ðŸ’¡ **Conclusion**: Copilot speeds up repetitive tasks like sorting and avoids small syntax mistakes. However, understanding the code logic is still essential to ensure correct use.
