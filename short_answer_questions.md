### Q1: Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?

AI-driven code generation tools like GitHub Copilot enhance productivity by:
- Suggesting code snippets in real-time based on context.
- Reducing boilerplate code writing.
- Speeding up prototyping by recommending standard implementations.

**Limitations:**
- May generate incorrect or insecure code.
- Lack understanding of project-specific requirements.
- Can reinforce bias or deprecated practices learned from training data.
- Developers still need to review and validate the output manually.

### Q2: Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.

**Supervised Learning:**
- Requires labeled data (e.g., examples of buggy vs. clean code).
- Can be used to classify known bug types or predict error-prone code.
- Offers higher accuracy when enough labeled data is available.

**Unsupervised Learning:**
- Does not require labeled data.
- Can detect anomalies or outliers that may represent bugs.
- Useful for discovering unknown or emerging bug patterns.

**Conclusion:**
Supervised learning is good for precision in known issues; unsupervised learning helps in exploring new bug patterns.

### Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

AI systems trained on biased data can:
- Deliver unfair or non-inclusive experiences (e.g., recommend content only to certain groups).
- Reinforce stereotypes or limit user exposure.
- Result in user distrust and ethical concerns.

**Mitigating bias** ensures fairness, diversity, and a positive experience for all users, especially in applications like content recommendation, UX design, and targeted features.
